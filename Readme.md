#Why I want to join Open_source
I want to join Open_Source team because it is like a backbone to everything we create digitally using codes.
In the future, I'll be working extensively on ML and AI and that is why I'll need to have good command over Open Source
and its workings.
I hope I get selected for the interview round where I could explain more about my interests in Open_source and coding as a whole.
